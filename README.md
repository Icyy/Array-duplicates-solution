Solution of the problem given below - 

The goal is to write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns another array of numbers. The returned array should have the following criterias met:

There should not be any duplicate numbers.
The array should be sorted by the decreasing amount of duplicates. If two numbers have the same amount of duplicates, the number that appeared earlier in the source array should appear earlier in the returned array.

Example - 
a = [2,9,9,1,6];
output = [9,2,1,6]
